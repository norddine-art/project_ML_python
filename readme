Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on various physicochemical properties. The model uses Linear Regression to predict a numerical quality score from the input features.

Dataset
The dataset used is wine_quality_classification.csv which contains:

Features: Various physicochemical properties of wines

Target: A quality label ('low', 'medium', 'high') converted to numerical values (3, 5, 7 respectively)

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Required Python packages:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
